CTO Nodes: Configure To Order Nodes -> Parts * slots can be selected based on WL requirements
Bundle Nodes: Parts are fixed i.e. one CPU choice, one RAM etc. whereas slots can vary

CTO Data entry instructions

HyperFlex Nodes
    > price is sum of chassis price after exclusion of service cost, mid-priced -> Power supply, RAID controller,
      MicroSD card, PCIe Riser cards etc.
    > filling up of parts doesn't require any modifications.
    > slot count should start at minimum required slots and should consist of all possible number for CPU, RAM, VRAM,
      SSD, For HDD it should represent a range of slots i.e. (minimum, maximum)

All-Flash Nodes
    > these nodes are priced in the same way as mentioned above.
    > Cache parts that are used in AF nodes should have very high Cache capacity of 100000000 so that cache isn't a
      constraint. Only IO/s should be considered.

Compute Nodes
    > Compute nodes' HDD/SSD i.e. Disk slots should be 0 as they don't have any storage capabilities.
    > Pricing just consists of Chassis price excluding service cost

Final Price of CTO nodes is base price of node + CTO price of all parts that we use.

Bundle Data entry instructions

Bundles nodes follow the same rules as CTO, except for pricing wherein we have to exclude the cost of base RAM
i.e. [minimum no of slots in node * unit price of that part]

Final Price of Bundle nodes is base price of node + Unit price of RAM * no of RAM slots used.
