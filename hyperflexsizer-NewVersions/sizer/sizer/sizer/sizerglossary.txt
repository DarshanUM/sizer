Raw Capacity:This is the total raw capacity. For example, if a node has 6 disks of 1.2TB each, then the total Raw Disk Capacity of the node is 6 * 1.2 = 7.2TB
Usable Capacity:This is the capacity after deducting the overhead needed for running the HyperFlex Controller VM. Specifically, for disk, we need to consider Replication Factor as well. For example, if the Disk overhead is 8%, then Usable Disk Capacity will be ((100 – 8)% * 7.2TB) / RF3 = 2.21TB
Effective Capacity:This is the capacity after taking Dedupe and Compression into consideration. For example, if Dedupe Savings is 10% and Compression Savings is 20%, then Effective Disk Capacity = 2.208TB / ((100 – 10)% * (100 – 20)%) = 3.07TB
Best Practice Threshold:This is the capacity after deducting the reserve that is needed to ensure that everything runs well. For example, if the Disk reserve is 30%, then the Best Practice Threshold Capacity = (100-30)% * 3.067TB = 2.15TB.
Node IOPS Conversion Ratio:This is the amount of IOPS that a node can support for the particular IOPS that are represented by the workload. As this varies by the workload type and the node selected, this number will change dramatically. This value is used to determine the number of nodes needed to satisfy the IOPS requirement. For example, if a node can support 10000 IOPS, this value is the divisor of 1000 input IOPS, to state that you need 0.1 nodes to satisfy the IOPS requirement of this particular workload.
SpecINT ratio:This is the ratio of the CPU SpecINT value used to normalizes to SpecINT values of Intel E5-2630 v4. For example, SpecINT Ratio of E5 2650 v4 = SpecINT value of 2650 / SpecINT value of 2630 = 38.5 / 38.23 = 1.007
