Traditional infrastructure can be complex with multiple silos to manage through what was described by 63% of the organizations in a recent 451 Research Voice of the Enterprise poll as “highly manual”.  This maintenance focused operations model leaves IT departments with limited time and budget to allocate for future initiatives that you know you need to address.
With IT budgets expected to remain flat, and IT staff time being limited to the fixed time in the day, how do you get from just keeping the lights on today, to being future ready for the distributed datacenter?  By modernizing your current infrastructure.
Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) has proven to yield impressive results with customers reporting 75% time savings in managing their infrastructure, 90% reduction in downtime, and 80% savings over traditional 3-tier infrastructure.  By combining virtualized computing, software defined storage and networking into a single pooled cluster, it’s simplicity allows HCI platforms to be implemented and managed by generalist IT staff, who do not need the expertise of storage and network specialists.  This enables you to spend less time managing your core infrastructure, and utilize your specialized staff to address strategic projects to advance the business.
Given that cloud and edge will figure largely in future IT environments, modernized on-premises core infrastructures utilizing HCI not only provide cloud-like in their delivery of IT resources, they are software based technologies, that easily integrate well with public cloud service providers as the foundation for hybrid infrastructures.  Additionally, and their modular architecture is easily adaptable to edge environments in the distributed datacenter.
